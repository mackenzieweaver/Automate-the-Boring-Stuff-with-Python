“By consultation, plans will succeed.”—Proverbs 20:18
We all need money to provide our families with the things they need. 
(Proverbs 30:8) After all, “money is a protection.” (Ecclesiastes 7:12) As a 
couple, it may be difficult to talk about money, but do not let money 
cause problems in your marriage. (Ephesians 4:32) A couple should trust 
each other and work together when deciding how money will be spent.
