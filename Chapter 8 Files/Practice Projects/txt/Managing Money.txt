“With those consulting together there is wisdom.” (Proverbs 13:10) 
Depending on your background, you may feel awkward when consulting others, 
especially your mate, about money matters. 
Even so, wisdom dictates that you learn to discuss this important subject. 
For example, why not describe to your spouse 
how you think you might have been affected by your parents’ attitude toward money? 
Also, try to understand how your mate’s background has influenced his or her attitude.
