"The plans of the diligent one surely make for advantage, 
but everyone that is hasty surely heads for want." (Proverbs 21:5) 
Don't rush to buy something just because it's on sale. 
Make a financial plan, a budget, and stick to it. Avoid unnecessary debt. 
"The borrower is a servant to the man doing the lending." (Proverbs 22:7) 
If you are already in debt and can't meet your obligations, 
try to negotiate new payment plans with your creditors. 
Be persistent. Use the Bible's advice to one who unwisely guarenteed a loan
and thus took on responsibility for the debt: 
"Humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 
Don't let your eyes rest or your eyelids close." (Proberbs 6:1-5, God's Word Bible) 
Even if your first request isn't successful, keep on asking for an adjustment.
