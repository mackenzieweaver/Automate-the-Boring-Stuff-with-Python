2 For example, researcher Jeffrey Dew found that 
3 couples in debt spend less time together, 
4 have more fights, and are less happy. 
5 Compared with other topics,

7 generate more yelling and hitting, 
8 and are more likely to carry over into other issues. 
9 It is no surprise, then, that the leading cause of divorce 
10 in the United States is disagreements about money.
