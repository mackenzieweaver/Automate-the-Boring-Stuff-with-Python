What the Bible says: 
“Who of you wanting to build a tower does not first sit down and 
calculate the expense to see if he has enough to complete it?” (Luke 14:28) 
It is essential that you plan together how you will use your money. (Amos 3:3) 
Decide what you need to buy and how much you can afford to spend. (Proverbs 31:16) 
Just because you have the money to buy something 
does not necessarily mean that you should. Try to avoid debt. 
Spend only the money you have.—Proverbs 21:5; 22:7.
