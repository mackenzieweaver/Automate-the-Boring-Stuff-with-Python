1. What is []?
A list begins with an opening square bracket and ends with a closing square bracket. The values inside the list are called items. The items are seperated with commas.


2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored
in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
spam[2] = 'hello'



For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list 
['a','b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] evaluate to?
spam[3] = 'd'


4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
spam[2] = 'd'


5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
'a', 'b'


For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].


6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1


7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]


8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]
It removes the first 'cat'


9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
+ and * 



10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
The .append() method adds to the list at the end, but the .insert() method adds into a place where you specify like spam.insert(1, 'chicken') that would add chicken in spam[1].


11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
You could use the remove() method or del using an index of a list. For example: 
eggs = [1, 2, 3]
del eggs[2]

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
You could consider a string to be a “list” of single text characters. Many of the things you can do with lists can also be done with strings: indexing; slicing; and using them with for loops, with len(), and with the in and not in operators.



13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
Tuples are typed with parentheses, and Tuples cannot have their values modified (they are immutable.


14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
Type a comma at the end of the parentheses like this
tuple = (42,)


15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? 
How can you get the list
form of a tuple value?
Use the keyword 'tuple' or 'list' then parentheses around the value to convert to tuple, and brackets around the value to convert to list. 

For example:
tuple(['cat', 'dog', 5])
or to go the other way, from tuple to list
Example:
list(('cat', 'dog', 5))


16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly.
What do they contain instead?
References


17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

copy.copy(), can be used to make a duplicate copy of a mutable value like a list or dictionary, not just a copy of a reference.

If the list you need to copy contains lists, then use the copy.deepcopy()
function instead of copy.copy(). The deepcopy() function will copy these
inner lists as well.
